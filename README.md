# Cruise_Line_booking_agency
Cruise Line booking agency that is created in a C# console application and can be interchanged with a forms application. 
This program was created as a small C# project combining the skills of sorting, classes, functions, data storage and data removal
The program is commented completely and explains every line of code

The program works by asking the user thier information such as name, age, accomodating guests, and cruise length. All information is stored in variables and will be used to book the cruise line and cruise. All data regarding vacant and occupied rooms is stored in a txt file where the program checks to see if the room is available. If the room is available it will allow the user to book it and will store that users info in the txt file. 

If the user needs to cancel a booking that is possible as well, the user needs to input their confirmation number and then they will be able to cancel thier booking
